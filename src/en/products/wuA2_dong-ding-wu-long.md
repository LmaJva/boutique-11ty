  The 凍頂烏龍 - DòngDǐng is one of the two main 烏龍 - WūLóng teas from Taiwan. Mr. 李 - Lǐ cultivates it in the 阿里山 - ĀLǐShān mountain and produces it using traditional methods. This tea takes us back to the memories of the tea salons in 臺灣 - Táiwān in the 1980s. Mr. 李 - Lǐ's family has been cultivating tea for three generations. I've known him for ten years, and he has always faithfully maintained his seriousness and sincerity in the making of his teas.
